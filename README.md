# Kotori
The core of Maika. 
The library requires MongoDB to be installed.

## Notes
I highly don't recommend using this as your base of your Discord bot since this for Maika only and has premade models that Maika uses for different features. I only made it public because:

- 1: NPM private packages costs $7 per member

So I don't recommend using this but you can use different components from Maika

### Other Components You Can Use
- [@maika.xyz/eris-utils](https://github.com/MaikaBot/eris-utils) - Strict "eris" utilities that Maika uses
- [@maika.xyz/miu](https://github.com/MaikaBot/miu) - Different key dependencies that Maika uses
- [@maika.xyz/hideri](https://github.com/MaikaBot/hideri) - Logger interface for Maika

### Other Components You Can't Use
- [@maika.xyz/rikka](https://github.com/MaikaBot/rikka) - Crowdin interface for Maika
